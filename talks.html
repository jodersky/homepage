### Channeling the Inner Complexity

An essential requirement for writing programs that scale is to have
constructs to model concurrency in an understandable, safe, and
efficient manner. This talk presents an overview of various such
models available in Scala, and their impact on program structure and
complexity. It then explores a way to model concurrency with less
complexity with an implementation of Communicating Sequential
Processes (CSP), heavily inspired by goroutines, scala-async and
Clojure's core.async.
