I believe in the merits of building software in the open and its free usage. Here is a list of side projects I've been working on.
<h2>Selected Projects</h2>
<p>These are the projects that are more involved and presentable.</p>
<div class="list-group row">
	{% for project in site.projects reversed %}
	<a class="list-group-item" href="{{ project.site }}">
		<h4>{{ project.title }} <small class="pull-right">{{project.year}}</small></h4>
		<div>
			{{ project.description }}
		</div>
	</a>
	{% endfor %}
</div>
